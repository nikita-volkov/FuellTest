EZTest

A testing library for coffee-script projects. 

Makes writing tests simple. Does not fall into the trend of verbosely describing every detail of your test as most modern testing frameworks do, instead it relies on self-describing assertion function names which themselves produce meaningful messages.

As fast as possible. Runs all your tests parallelly.

Supports testing of asynchronous functions with callbacks.
