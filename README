FuellTest

A robust testing library for CoffeeScript/JavaScript which simplifies testing features after implementation and introduces simple testing model of asynchronous functions.

Makes writing tests simple. Does not fall into the trend of verbosely describing every detail of your test as most modern testing frameworks do, instead it relies on self-describing assertion function names which themselves produce meaningful messages.

As fast as possible. Runs all your tests parallelly.

Supports testing of asynchronous functions with callbacks.

Here's how the contents of a sample file may look like:
  
  exports.tests = 
    "a failing 'a, b' test": ->
      @equals "a", "b"
    "a failing test with some successfull assertions": ->
      @equals 1, 1
      @equals 2, 1

Or like so if it's JavaScript you're using:

  exports.tests = {
    "a failing 'a, b' test": function() {
      this.equals "a", "b"
    },
    "a failing test with some successfull assertions": function() {
      this.equals 1, 1
      this.equals 2, 1
    }
  };

To run your suites execute either of the following commands from the root of your project:
  `fuell-test` - if your tests are located in the `test` folder
  `fuell-test path/to/test/folder/` - otherwise

To see the colored output add a `--pretty` or `-p` parameter if your console supports it.
